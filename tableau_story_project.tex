\section{Summary}
This project investigates cancellations in the year 2008 for airlines in the
United States. The data set was combined with geospatial data from Data.gov to
show patterns of cancellations on a map of the United States.  Further
exploration highlights specific airlines that are consistently poor performers
in terms of cancellation rate.

\section{Design}
My first design decision was to incorporate geospatial data in order to better
visualize how cancellation rates vary across the United States.  In the
visualizations I used both Number of Flights and Cancellation Rate to reflect
the scale of activity.  I believe this choice facilitates quickly identifying
both the most active airports and airports/airlines with relatively higher
cancellation rates.

One change incorporated from the feedback I received was to remove information
that was not contributing to the desired take-away from the visualization.  In
the case of the maps, this involved limiting the amount of information being
shown (limiting the number of carriers).  I also translated carrier codes into
carrier names for readability.

\section{Feedback}
The feedback I received centered around making the visualizations more concise.
On the maps I was asked to zoom in cluttered regions such as the
northeast.  Also, limiting the visualization to only carriers of interest.  For
the box-plot the reviewer pointed out that I was showing redundant information by
including color to reflect cancellation rate, which was already clearly
reflected by the y-axis.  The reviewer also pointed out that carrier codes
needed to be changed to actual carrier names.
